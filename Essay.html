            <font color="black"><b>
<p>The Sengrijan River, a small tributary of the Dhansiri River, meanders through the heart of Sengrijan village in the Chumukedima circle of Dimapur district. This watercourse, akin to a lifeline, holds profound significance in the lives of the local residents. Our narrative essay delves into our exploration of the river and the water-related issues we uncovered through conversations and observations during our memorable expedition. Join us as we unveil the symbiotic relationship between the Sengrijan River and the community it sustains.</p>

<p>Our journey to Sengrijan Village was motivated by one of our team members who hails from this community. She believed that despite the river's substantial contributions to the community's well-being, it remained underappreciated and overlooked. To rectify this, we chose the Sengrijan River as the subject of our project. In pursuit of answers, we embarked on a journey that included candid conversations with various water users, such as farmers, residents, and even children.</p>

<p>Our initial interviewee was a farmer who regarded the river as an extension of his family. For him, the river served as a reliable source of water for irrigating his fields, laundering clothes, drinking, and even fishing. The second interviewee, a young child, enthusiastically recounted his fishing adventures in the river, specifically targeting catfish hiding beneath the rocks and snails (hamok). Subsequent interviews with three more individuals yielded similar accounts. It became evident that the river played a multifaceted role, serving purposes ranging from irrigation and fishing to domestic use and recreation. Its accessibility, as it flowed conveniently through nearly every household and field, encouraged extensive usage. Digging borewells or wells remained an expensive endeavor, and the majority of the community, consisting primarily of farmers and middle-class workers, relied on the river due to economic constraints. Only a few affluent individuals possessed borewells or wells. Interestingly, the community mentioned that wells, which were more prevalent in the past, had now mostly dried up.</p>

<p>However, like a coin with two sides, our interviews also unveiled some challenges. The most common issue voiced by all was the high iron content in the river water. Despite its abundance, the water required rigorous filtration before it could be considered safe for drinking. As most villagers were primarily farmers, purchasing drinking water regularly was financially burdensome. Therefore, they followed a time-consuming process of filtering the water using traditional methods, involving sand, charcoal, and coarse sand, followed by thorough boiling and additional filtration. Unfortunately, this prolonged exposure to iron-laden water had led to numerous gastrointestinal problems within the community, including constipation and stomach discomfort. Additionally, the iron content was notorious for turning white clothes a reddish hue. These were prevalent issues that the community faced, highlighting concerns about the river's water quality. When asked if the water quality had remained consistent over the years, respondents noted that while had generally remained similar, they believed that the iron content had increased recently, albeit without a clear explanation. Some speculated that the soil or the river's source might be contributing factors.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, the community had observed a significant increase in the river's water quantity over time, contrary to our initial assumption that it might have decreased. They pointed to the river's transformation from the past to the present, indicating a substantial increase in size (a sketch to illustrate this change will be provided). This remarkable growth led them to speculate that if the trend continued, the Sengrijan River might eventually evolve into a much larger watercourse.</p>

<p>Moving on to the river's impact on local flora and fauna, initial confusion among the interviewees gave way to insightful observations. They believed that the river played a crucial role in fostering greenery throughout the area. The lush vegetation and towering trees, in turn, supported a diverse range of birds and animals, contributing to a rich aquatic ecosystem. The vibrant sounds of chirping birds and the soothing rush of the river stood as testament to the area's vitality.</p>

<p>Our interview then turned to the critical question of whether human activities had negative effects on the river. The unanimous response was an emphatic "yes," although most community members did not consider the issue with the seriousness it deserved. They acknowledged that their reliance on the river for bathing and laundry had both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, it offered convenience and reduced the need to transport water to their homes. However, the negative impacts included concerns about environmental pollution from detergents that disrupted aquatic life and significant soil erosion along the riverbanks. One interviewee expressed particular concern over declining fish populations, attributing it to polluted water. He explained how pollution reduced oxygen levels in the water, disrupting the aquatic food chain and introducing toxic chemicals harmful to fish. This revelation prompted us to reflect on the current state of the river's fish population and its implications..</p>
                <p>After having interviewed,and understanding their perspectives they have on water,we took a new purpose that was to not only understand the general public's view on water but also to enlighten ,make them aware and knowledgable about water and its importance upon analyzing their viewpoints,it became evident that there was a knowledge gap existed in the people of the village.Now the so-called'interview atmosphere' turned into an 'interactive learning hub' where all of us shared our own viewpoints.Our team ,armed with our charts and engaging presentations,engaged in conversations with our interviewee.The narrative begagn with an exploration of the gloabal water crisis.through our Wipro Earthian booklet ,we shared about the looming scarcity of water. We told them that, out of all the water present in the world,there is only 2.5% of freshwater .This 2.5% of water must meet the needs and demands of 7.8billion people,which is just a magnificient number. We also added this point that in this 2.5% of freshwater,only 0.49% of water is the surface freshwater which is in the form of rivers and lakes,and we humans get most of the portion of freshwater from there.As ,we shared them this facts about water,the expressions on the faces of our interviewees changed from utmost curiosity to realization because they grasped the link of their actions on the balance of water.The conversation now naturally diverted towards climate change and water.This topic served as a reminder to the people that,how we treat water has a very big impact on the climate </p>

               
            <p>The discussion started with an exploration on the climate crisis of the world,where it has been proved that there has been an increase of 1degree clesius in the earths temperature in the last 400 years.We also tolf them that this temperature is projected to rise ove 3 degree Celsius by the end of this century as a study showed run through Climateprediction.net with the help of BBC Climate change experiment.After this we told them about the condition of groundwater in the state,which ws according to the NorthEast ground water report.It says that the availability  of groundwater in Dimapur was 15,320 hectares meter which have reduced to 2865.6 hectares since 2013.</p>
            <p>Our interciewees were engaged with the availability of groundwater.They saw how climate change wasn't a distant threat but a reality they were not only worried about themselves but also for generations to come.They asked us that what will be the severe effects,if this condition of groundwater continues like this.On this we responded,decreasing ground water levels,as we discussed have many severe consequences,like water scarcity which will lead to people having difficulty in accessing clean and freshwater for daily uses.Secondly we told them about agricultural impact,because the people there were mostly dependant on agriculture so it was important for them to know about its effect .We told them that declining water table which will have an effect on the productivity  of the crops.Thirdly we told them about the long-term consequences of ground water depletion which once depleted will be a very challenging task to restore ,even if the people take conservation measures.Our discussions on the consequences of decreasing groundwater levels were not only informative but also deply insightful.During our conversation,we found their concern for the environment.In our conversation,we found their concern for the environment.In our conversation with local residents living in Segrijan village,we shared some water conservation techniques that individuals and communities can adopt to foster a healthy environment.These techniques were deeply rooted in sustainable practices,which have the potential to make a significant impact if done on a large scale by the people.One particularly effective practice that emerged from our discussions is rainwater harvesting.This technique involves collecting and storing rainwater for various household and agricultural needs.By utilizing rainwater,the residents can not only reduce their reliance on ground water and riverwater but also contribute to groundwater replinishments during monsoon seasons.which can promote a sustainable water cycle.</p>
            <p> our interviewees told us about tales of residents who took the initiative of plantingf trees along the riverbanks which helped in preventing soil erosion,and also providing habitats for the wildlife of area .Though it was done,in a small scale,still we encouraged them because this was a very big devolopment among the mindsets of the people and will also help in enriching the surrounding environment.We also talked on responsible farming and fishing methods because as stated earlier,one of our interviewee was very concerned about it,so we told them about sustainable fishing methods such as mesh sizes that prevent the capture of undersized or small-sized fishes.Similarly,we talked to them on using eco-friendly farming techniques,such as reducing the use of pesticides and practicing crop rotation because most of the people they are farmers and their fields are directly connected with the river and so the pesticides from the fields flows directly into the river and affect the aquatic life.These approaches not only helped in ensuring the health of the river and so the pesticides from the fields flows directly into the river not only helped in ensuring the halth of the river but also ensure the long-term sustainability of livelihoods .We came across this situation from the interviewees that there are no authorities that looks after the sanitation  of the river.But when looked at the river by ourselves we were quite fascinated because there was not a wrapper of candy in and around the riversidesm,it was so clean so we asked our interviewees about it and they responded that the residents are very mindfull about the disposal of plastic in the loacality and we also agrred to it.</p>
            <p>After having a very long conversation with them on sustainable practices,we thought of sharing something interesting so,we shared an eye-opening topic that they listened so earnestly which was "hidden water in our food".We started off by telling them that many people don't realize that producing 1kg of beef meat required 15,500 litres of water.So them eatingb 1 kg of beef meat was equivalent to 15,500 litres of water.From the lettuce leaf to a piece of meat,each item on our plates carried a hidden water story.We didn't just told them about how much water is required to make certain food items but also made them conscious on their food choices and reducing the consumption of products  where water is intensively used.In this way they could significantly contribute to water conservation efforts.</p>
            <p>Throughout our discussio we have dived into a diverse aspect of water conservation .We uncovered a lot of knowledge and experiences  through this trip that provided us with immense knowledge.</p>
            <p>We got a very differenr perspective of water because we physically went there and witnessed everything said by the people.And so together with them we pledged to become champions of water conservation,fostering a world where river flows freely,agriculture flourishes sustainably and communities thrive in harmony with their environments.</p>
            <p>With profound thanks and appreciation,we conclude this chapter of our journeys armed with insights and inspiration to create a more sustainable,water-secure world for generations to come</p></font></b>
